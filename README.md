# getSensorData
This App is originally designed for Recon jet.

All the images and other resources used are from open-resource.

This App can be used to track the sensors data, including the accelerometer, the gyroscope and the magnetometer. You can choose to view the data live on the screen or save it to a file.

There is an android phone version as well.
